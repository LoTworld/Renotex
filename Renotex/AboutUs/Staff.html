<tr><td><p>All work is performed by company employees not sub-contractors.</p>
	<p>Sales and supervisory personnel are experienced, thoroughly trained in all aspects of the industry, and kept informed by continuing educational training programs both in-house and by outside certification firms.</p>
	<p>Experience is one of the most important factors in providing quality service.  The average length of service for our employees is over five years and supervisory employees have an even higher average of over ten years.</p>
	<p>This is the result of a company philosophy to minimize turnover and retain employees who show a willingness to put customer satisfaction first.  All employees whether in service, sales or office, know that our prime goal is to provide prompt courteous response.</p> </td>
