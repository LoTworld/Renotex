		Renotex not only offers every major cleaning method, but has played a part in the development of most of them.</p>
		<p>Proper use of any method involves a number of different steps and procedures.  These include dry vacuuming prior to cleaning, spot cleaning by hand and proper finishing of the carpet fiber following cleaning.</p>
		<p>The descriptions of various methods below list the procedures which are unique to each.  It is important to note however that these individual differences are always part of a complete procedure.</p></td>

	<td><p><a name="Rotary"><span class="h5">Rotary Shampoo</span></a><br />
		The carpet is cleaned by a rotary machine using a soft brush and a specially formulated neutral detergent.  The brushing action is just enough to break the bond between soil and the carpet fiber, but gentle enough that it is less abrasive than a normal upright vacuum.</p>
		<p>The detergent used is made under our name to our specifications and contains a soil retardant to help keep your carpet looking cleaner longer.</p>
		<p>Shampoo cleaning became part of our service when synthetic detergents with built in soil retardant's were developed in the late 1940's,   Renotex together with Bigelow Sanford, which was the largest carpet manufacturer at that time, developed procedures, equipment and chemicals for the rotary shampoo method.  This method was so effective that other competing carpet manufacturers endorsed and recommended it on a wide spread basis.</p></td>

<tr><td><p><a name="Steam"><span class="h5">Hot Water Extraction (Steam)</span></a><br />
		A solution of  water and detergent is injected into the carpet under pressure.  It is then immediately extracted together with soil and spots which have been loosened and suspended.</p>
		<p>This method which had been used in some rug cleaning plants over the years, was adapted to be used on-location in the 1960's.  Renotex was the first cleaner in the New York area to offer this new process in the late 1960's.</p></td>

	<td><p><a name="Dry"><span class="h5">Dry</span></a><br />
		The basis of this system is a dry compound which contains a blend of solvents.  This compound is applied to the carpet and then brushed in with equipment designed to disperse it evenly and work it deep into the carpet pile. The compound absorbs soil and stains as it dries.  Thorough vacuuming when dry removes the dry compound together with the dissolved soil and spots.</p>
		<p>Dry cleaning was our major method in the 1940's because the wet methods available at that time tended to leave residue which could attract soil.</p></td>

		A number of other methods are also available such as bonnet cleaning (absorbent pad) and dry foam and our experience with them also dates back several generations.  These methods are generally faster and less costly but also less effective than the methods listed above..</p></td>
